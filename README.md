# Nixie Clock Clock Driver for ATTiny-85
## And a bunch of shift registers and stuff

This is code for a fine-tunable ATTiny-85 driven clock. I am using it to drive some custom Nixie modules I have, but realy it could be used in any situation where you want to drive a bunch of shift registers with an ATTiny-85.

I also have some code specifically for fine-tuning a clock function to keep accurate time to within a few seconds a month with a garden-variety clock crystal. I'll share more about how that tuning is done in a later commit.
